This repository contains my collection of custom scripts for the client Raven BS designed to enhance and automate Minecraft gameplay.
I develop and maintain all scripts located in this repository.
I also manage all the documentation, which you can find here: [Raven Documentation](https://blowsy.gitbook.io/raven).
If you always wish to have the latest update for any scripts here, please use a loadstring to the raw file on GitHub.
